# Indices for jazz real / fake books

This repository is intended to be a high quality, collaboratively
edited collection of indices for well known jazz
[real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Book) /
[fake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book) books, rooted in the
belief that [Open Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) is
often the most beneficial approach.

If you spot any mistakes or want to contribute a new index, you are
extremely welcome to do so
[right now](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository)!

## How to use these indices

Assuming you have a PDF of a real / fake book whose contents are
described by one of these indices:

-   You can split the large PDF into many small PDF files, one per
    song, using my [PDFexploder
    tool](https://github.com/aspiers/PDFexploder).

-   Use [Birdland Musician's
    Assistant](https://birdland.wrwetzel.com/) which is a Linux-based
    multimedia music viewer and library manager for music books in PDF
    form including fakebooks.

-   Use https://github.com/neshanjo/fakebook-splitter which is based
    on NodeJS and `pdftk` so should work with Windows/Mac/Linux.

-   Use https://codeberg.org/strk/splitPDF which is very fast and
    broadly compatible ( https://perl-begin.org/platforms/ )

-   You can use this [utility for
    Windows](https://github.com/Sogolumbo/Music-Book-Index-Search)
    which provides a GUI for quickly searching the indices and jumping
    to the right page in the PDF.

-   [forScore](https://forscore.co) 10 for iPad adds [a feature that
    allows you to add indexes to large scores by uploading a CSV file
    that links the song titles to specific page numbers of the
    PDF](http://www.robbyburns.com/blog/adding-an-index-for-your-real-books-in-forscore).

If you know of any other ways to use them, please submit the details
via [a new issue](https://github.com/aspiers/book-indices/issues/new)
, or even better, via a pull request as described immediately below.

## How to contribute

The format of these index files is extremely simple to understand, so
anyone should be able to make contributions - it's the very well-known
[CSV (or Comma-Separated Values) format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values),
which can be edited via countless pieces of software.  The easiest way
by far is
[editing directly on this website (github)](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

If you really want to edit or build new indices offline, two of the
most obvious choices are
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/features/calc/) and
[Microsoft Excel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel).  But
the format is so simple that it's just as easy to use a text editor.

Once your contributions are ready, you will have to
[send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
which requires learning a bit about [git](http://git-scm.com/), so
unless you're particularly computer savvy, I'd recommend sticking with
the online approach.

## File format

Each line in an index file contains:

1.  the name of a tune
2.  the number of the first page of the tune within the PDF file
3.  (optional) the number of the last page of the tune within the PDF file

For example:

    Stormy Weather,452,453

means that the tune Stormy Weather starts on page 452 and finishes on
the next page.

The final page number is optional, because it can often be
automatically inferred by the starting page of the next tune, and this
makes indices a lot easier to type, edit, and read.  For example, here
the first tune can be assumed to be only one page long, i.e. finishing
on page 391:

    Seven Come Eleven,391,
    Seven Steps To Heaven,392,

Sometimes a tune will actually bleed over onto a page on which another
tune starts, in which case its final page can be manually specified to
eliminate the chance of the computer guessing wrong.

Note that these page numbers refer to the number of the page in the
PDF, **not** the number you will see printed at one of the corners of
the page!  They are usually different because the numbering in the
original books does not simply start at 1 and increase in a perfect
sequence due to the presence of cover pages, prefaces, indices,
appendices etc. which are usually excluded from the printed numbering.

As you can see, the three values are separated by commas.  If the name
of the tune contains a comma, then you must surround the whole tune
name with double quotes, e.g.

    "Night In Tunisia, A",20,

(This repository adopts the standard that tunes whose name begins with
"A" or "The" should place the
[definite or indefinite article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar))
at the end of the name, after a comma, in order to facilitate a more
useful alphabetical sorting order.)

If the tune itself already contains double quotes, then you must also
double those double quotes:

    "Take The ""A"" Train",434,

Even though this is not part of the CSV standard, it is also permitted
to add blank lines and comment lines, which begin with the `#` symbol.
However in order to avoid breaking
[GitHub's file editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/),
it's necessary to ensure that comment lines have the same number of
commas as the other lines, and to avoid incompatibiliity with the CSV
format by ensuring that if the first field of a commented line is
quoted, the `#` symbol must go *inside* the quotes, not outside.  So
these are valid comments:

    # All Of Me,18,
    "# All Of Me",18,

but this is not:

    # "All Of Me",18,

Finally, UNIX line endings are used, rather than MS-DOS / Windows-style
[CR/LF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) line endings.

I am not a lawyer, but I understand that there is a slim chance that
these indices could be argued to be derivative works of copyrighted
material.  If so, they are distributed under
[fair use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), since:

*   the distribution is not for profit,
*   the distribution cannot negatively impact the expected revenue from
    or market for the original works (in fact if anything it should
    increase it),
*   the indices substantially less than the original work, and
*   considerable original effort was invested in creating accurate indices.
